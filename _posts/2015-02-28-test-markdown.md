Our REST API is a web-based API using a Websocket connection and was developed with algorithmic trading in mind.

Developers and investors can create custom trading applications, integrate into our platform, back test strategies and build robot trading. Calls can be made in any language that supports a standard HTTP.

We utilize the new OAuth 2.0 specification for authentication via token. This allows for a more secure authorization to access your application and can easily be integrated with web applications, mobile devices, and desktop platforms

With the use of the socket.io library, the API has streaming capability and will push data notifications in a JSON format. Your application will have access to our real-time streaming market data, subscribe in real time access to trading tables and place live trades.
